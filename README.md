##Good Morning!

An app that will play your personal music directory, tell you this week's weather for SF, and give you a personal todo list app.

##USAGE:

* Create a music directory in the same root folder. Make sure it is named "music"
* Add music (.mp3 or .m4a) files to this /music folder!
* Execute the music_renamer.rb to reformat the music filenames so it is compatiable with this program.
* Add your name to execute_good_morning.rb 13 as the argument.
* Run "execute_good_morning.rb"
